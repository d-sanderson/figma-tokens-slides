<!-- section-title: 4 - Designer Workflow -->

## Designer Workflow

1. A designer updates variables in Figma.
2. Using the [Tokens Studio Figma Plugin](https://tokens.studio/):
   - A designer imports the updated Figma variables.
   - A designer pushes the updated tokens (W3C compliant design tokens) to the `develop` branch.
   - A designer opens a pull request to merge `develop` into `main`.

<!-- note
What does that workflow actually look like? It starts with the designer
